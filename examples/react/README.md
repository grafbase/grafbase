# Grafbase тип React

[Join our Community](https://grafbase.com/community)

This example uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) library, with `create-react-app`. In production environments, you should switch to a supported [auth provider](https://grafbase.com/docs/auth/providers) using the `Authorization` header with requests to secure your data.

## Getting Started

1. Run `npx degit grafbase/grafbase/examples/react grafbase-with-react` to clone this example
2. Change directory into the new folder `cd grafbase-with-react`
3. Run `cp .env.example .env`
4. Open `.env` in your code editor and provide your Grafbase API endpoint and API key. Example should be fine for `npx grafbase dev`!
5. Run `npm install`, or `yarn install` to install dependencies
6. Run `npx grafbase@latest dev` in your terminal
7. Populate the backend with some `Message` entries using a GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  messageCreate(
    input: { author: "Grafbase Admin", body: "Grafbase is awesome!" }
  ) {
    message {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

8. In another terminal, run `npm start` and visit [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/)
