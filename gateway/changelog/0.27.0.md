## Features

We introduce the schema file hot reload feature. This feature lets you update the schema file without restarting the gateway; the gateway automatically reloads the schema file when it detects a change in the file. Often, you do not want the gateway to load the latest schema file from the Graph Delivery Network. Previously, updating the schema required a full gateway restart.

With this feature, the gateway polls for changes to the file every five seconds:

- Check if the modification time has changed.
- If the file system does not support the previous check, the gateway calculates a hash of the file and compares it to the previous hash.

We chose polling over file system notifications because the latter is not supported on all platforms and can be unreliable.

Now users who choose to load the schema from the file also benefit from the [query warming feature](https://grafbase.com/docs/reference/gateway/configuration/operation-caching). If enabled, the gateway keeps the caches warm when the schema changes.

## Fixes

- Dependency updates.
