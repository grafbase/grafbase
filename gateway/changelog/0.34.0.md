## Breaking changes

- Renamed `mcp.include_mutations` to `mcp.execute_mutations` in the configuration. Now it only prevents execution of mutation, not their query generation.
- Removed native `scalar BigInt` support. It won't have any impact at runtime, but previously it was automatically part of the schema, so the gateway wouldn't fail previously if this scalar was used without being defined first.
