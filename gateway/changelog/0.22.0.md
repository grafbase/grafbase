### Breaking: New SDK for Grafbase Gateway Hooks

If you are using the Grafbase Gateway hooks feature, you need to update your hooks to use the new SDK. This means that you do not need to maintain a WIT file anymore. The new SDK provides helpful traits and types for implementing hooks. The SDK also includes macros for deriving the required traits for your hooks and registering them with the gateway.

To get started, read the [Implementing Gateway Hooks guide](https://grafbase.com/docs/guides/implementing-gateway-hooks) and update your hooks to use the new SDK.

To read more about the SDK and why we made this change, see the [Introducing Grafbase Hooks SDK blog post](https://grafbase.com/changelog/introducing-grafbase-hooks-sdk).

## Fixes

- Improved handling of inaccessible objects behind interfaces and unions, enabling null propagation without exposing errors to the client.
- Enhanced error propagation strategies when processing invalid subgraph responses, making errors clearer and simplifying the response handling structure.
- Updated deserialization logic to accept a broader range of types, preventing deserialization errors when encountering unexpected data types (e.g., lists instead of strings).
- Improved management of entities within federation, allowing distinct treatment of entity responses and their requirements.
- Reworked serialization logic to ensure correct handling of unexpected input types, like transitioning from float to integer coercion.
- Added numerous tests focusing on serde failures, ensuring resilience against deserialization errors in JSON responses.
- Introduced specific tests related to `requires-with-fragments` to validate that responses correctly propagate object definition IDs.
- Updated non-major dependencies across the engine and hooks.
- Switched from `cargo-component` to `wasm32-wasip2` target for hooks.
- Removed unused dependencies and the now obsolete `engine-parser`, transitioning to `cynic-parser` for improved performance.
