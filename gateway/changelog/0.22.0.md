### Breaking: New SDK for Grafbase Gateway Hooks

If you are using the Grafbase Gateway hooks feature, you need to update your hooks to use the new SDK. This means that you do not need to maintain a WIT file anymore. The new SDK provides helpful traits and types for implementing hooks. The SDK also includes macros for deriving the required traits for your hooks and registering them with the gateway.

To get started, read the [Implementing Gateway Hooks guide](https://grafbase.com/docs/guides/implementing-gateway-hooks) and update your hooks to use the new SDK.

To read more about the SDK and why we made this change, see the [Introducing Grafbase Hooks SDK blog post](https://grafbase.com/changelog/introducing-grafbase-hooks-sdk).
