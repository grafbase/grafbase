### Breaking changes

- The gateway will now try to expand environment variables everywhere in the configuration with the syntax `{{ env.VAR_NAME }}`.

### Features

- feat(engine): Composite batch key/lookup matching
- feat(engine): Add @oneOf support
- feat(gb-8838): Fix empty arguments for postgres

## Fixes

- The gateway now accepts the `extension` directive on the `@join__type` federated directive. It is valid but previously caused a validation error on startup.
- fix(engine): avoid crashing with x-grafbase-telemetry & lookup
- fix(engine): Proper shape computation for lookup fields. Fixed an index range issue that caused the root selection set to include all nested fields.
- fix(engine): Fix incorrect interpretation of `resolvable: false` in `@join__type`. The engine was incorrectly triggering entity joins for lookup fields. `resolvable` indicates availability via Apollo `_entities`, not field existence within a subgraph.
- fix(engine): infinite debug loop
- fix(composition): Corrected a bug where directive imports with `@link(imports:)` sometimes exceeded their subgraph scope.
