### Breaking changes

* The gateway will now try to expand environment variables everywhere in the configuration with the syntax `{{ env>VAR_NAME }}`.

### Features

* feat(engine): Composite batch key/lookup matching
* feat(engine): Add @oneOf support
* feat(gb-8838): Fix empty arguments for postgres

## Fixes

* The gateway now accepts the `extension` directive on the `@join__type` federated directive. It is valid but previously caused a validation error on startup.
* fix(engine): avoid crashing with x-grafbase-telemetry & lookup
* fix(engine): Proper shape computation for lookup fields. Fixed an index range issue that caused the root selection set to include all nested fields.
* fix(engine): Fix incorrect interpretation of `resolvable: false` in `@join__type`. The engine was incorrectly triggering entity joins for lookup fields. `resolvable` indicates availability via Apollo `_entities`, not field existence within a subgraph.
* fix(engine): infinite debug loop
* fix(composition): Corrected a bug where directive imports with `@link(imports:)` sometimes exceeded their subgraph scope.
