## Features

Query warming and operation cache configuration. Query warming allows to pre-warm the cache with queries that are expected to be run in the future. You can set it up in the operation caching configuration:

```toml
[operation_caching]
enabled = true # Enable operation caching, default is true
limit = 1000 # Maximum number of operations to cache, default is 1000
warm_on_reload = false # Warm the cache on reload, default is false
warming_percent = 100 # Percentage of cache to warm, default is 100
```

Query warming only works if using the Graph Delivery Network (GDN), and the gateway gets a federated schema update from the GDN.

## Fixes

- Various fixes in query planning, most notably better handling of type conditions and skip/include
- Updated dependencies
- Operation cache speedups

## Breaking

- Rename `__GRAFBASE_OTEL_URL` environment variable to `GRAFBASE_OTEL_URL`
