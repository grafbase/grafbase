## Configurable websocket path

The gateway has a configuration option for the graphql endpoint:

```toml
[graph]
path = "/custom" # default: "/graphql"
```

But until now, the websocket endpoint is always exposed at `/ws`. This release introduces a `websocket_path` option to configure this.

```toml
[graph]
path = "/custom" # default: "/graphql"
websocket_path = "/subscriptions" # default: "/ws"
```
