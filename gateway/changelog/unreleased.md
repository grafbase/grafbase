## Improvements

- The gateway now transparently supports gzip, brotli, deflate, and zstd compression for subgraph responses. It will advertise support through the `Accept-Encoding` header. That does not apply to the body of requests from the gateway to the subgraph, only responses. If you need opt-in request body compression, please contact us and it will be added in short notice.
