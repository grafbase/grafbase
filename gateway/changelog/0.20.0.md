## Features

- Pathfinder, the GraphQL query tool in Grafbase's dashboard, can now show the query plan and the trace for an operation. It relies on a new default behavior of the Grafbase gateway that exposes it whenever `x-grafbase-telemetry` request header is present. Further details can be found in the [configuration documentation](https://grafbase.com/docs/self-hosted-gateway/telemetry#exposing-the-query-plan-and-trace-id-in-the-response).
- Added an MVP of complexity controls for blocking overly complex GraphQL
  queries.  This can be enabled in config with:

```toml
[complexity_control]
mode = "enforce"
limit = 10000
list_size = 10
```

By default objects have a complexity of 1 and scalars have a complexity of 0.
The default settings can be controlled using the `@cost` & `@listSize`
directives in your schema.
