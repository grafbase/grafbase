## Breaking Changes

- The `scheduled_delay` and `timeout` configuration options for telemetry exporters have been updated to accept a duration string instead of a number (https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/pull/2962).

## Features

- Made the GDN poll url configurable (#2990)

  For enterprise platform users who do not use the GDN (Graph Delivery Network), but instead their own HTTP endpoint to serve schemas.

  The feature takes the form of a new gateway configuration option:

  ```
  [graph]
  schema-fetch-url = "https://my-custom-s3-bucket/my-account-id/{{ graph-ref.graph }}/{{ graph-ref.branch }}"
  ```

  The following variables are available in the url template:

  - `graph-ref.graph` : the graph name from the graph ref the gateway was started with.
  - `graph-ref.branch`: the optional branch name from the graph ref the gateway was started with.

- Opt-in MCP server support. Stay tuned for a release announcement.

## Improvements

- Improved the error messages on extension loading
- Extension versions are now taken into account in operation caching (#2946)
