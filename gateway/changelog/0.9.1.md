### Fixes

- Fix rendering of multiline strings in federated graph SDL (https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/pull/2021)
- Fix excessive strictness in the Content-Type headers we accepted following the strict implementation of Graphql-over-HTTP. Content-Type headers with parameters (for example "application/json;charset=utf-8") are now accepted again. (https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/pull/2023)
