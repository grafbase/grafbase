## Changes

- On 4xx for supbgraph response we now just try to parse the response instead of failing immediately.
- Allow modifying the response status code with SDK 0.23 `on_response` hook.

## Fixes

- Fixed `try_` methods in the SDK's Cache (SDK 0.23)
- Remove `http.route` from extension HTTP metrics
- Fix planning error when using an interface fragment on a root operation type.
