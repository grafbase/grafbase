### Access Log Rotation by Size

In version 0.12.0, we introduced a streamlined method for logging and storing access information using the Gateway Hooks. In this version we rewrote the logger into a faster and more minimal version. Now, you can rotate the log based on file size, configurable as follows:

```toml
[gateway.access_logs]
enabled = true
path = "./logs"
rotate.size = 10_000_000 # bytes
```

The rotation mechanism is now standardized. The active log file is named `access.log`. When a rotation occurs, we rename this file to `access.log.X`, where X is the timestamp of the original log file's creation.

### Fixes

- Enforced inaccessibility of inaccessible arguments.
- Engine returns `null` for inaccessible enum values.
- Parser correctly handles null values.
- Replaced the parser crate with a faster alternative, improving performance for parsing large schemas.
