## Features

- Add support for disabling automatic persisted queries (APQ):

  ```toml
  [apq]
  enabled = false
  ```

- Add operation caching configuration:

  ```toml
  [oeration_caching]
  enabled = true
  limit = 5000
  ```

## Fixes

- Gateway could send invalid queries to subgraphs in certain conditions with fragments.
