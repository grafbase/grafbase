### Features

* A new option, `for_operation_analytics_only`, has been added to the schema builder. This enables the construction of a schema specifically tailored for operation analytics, potentially optimizing the process by excluding elements not relevant to analytics, such as certain extension loading steps.
* SDK & WASI Loader: Kafka Integration:
    * The Grafbase SDK (`grafbase-sdk`) now includes a `kafka` module, enabling extensions to produce and consume messages from Kafka topics.
    * The WASI component loader has been updated to support these new Kafka producer and consumer resources, allowing extensions to leverage this functionality.

### Bug Fixes & Improvements

* Engine Logging:
    * Operation warming log messages are now at `DEBUG` level instead of `INFO`.
    * Subgraph request failures (non-success HTTP status) are now logged at `DEBUG` level instead of `ERROR` to reduce noise for expected errors.
* MCP Search: Ensured field values are correctly added as strings during schema indexing.
