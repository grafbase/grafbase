### Features

Breaking: the Grafbase Gateway does not allow batching by default. To enable batching, set the `gateway.batching.enabled` option to `true` in the gateway configuration. You can also limit the number of requests that can be batched by setting the `gateway.batching.limit` option to a number greater than 0. If the limit is not set, the default is to have no limit which might allow denial of service attacks, so be careful when setting this option.

```toml
[gateway.batching]
enabled = true
limit = 5
```

#### Fixes

- Improved tracing to track subgraph HTTP requests as spans, removing unnecessary instrumentation that spammed traces.
- Removed unnecessary fuel consumption tracking in hooks, making CPU heavy hooks more efficient.

#### Chores

- Updated dependencies across the project, including a major update to crucial libraries and tools.
