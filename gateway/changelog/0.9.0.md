### Breaking Changes

- Gateway now requires the `Accept` header as recommended in the GraphQL-over-HTTP specification ([spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http). Use `application/json` to have the same behavior as previous versions.

### Features

- Added entity caching ([docs](https://grafbase.com/docs/self-hosted-gateway/entity-caching))
- Follow GraphQL-over-HTTP specification ([spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http), [errors doc](https://grafbase.com/docs/federation/error-codes))
- Add support for using a SSE connection to a subgraph for subscriptions. If the websocket URL is absent, we will start a SSE connection with following header `Accept: text/even-stream,application/json;q=0.9`.
- Add `request_body_limit` in the configuration, which defaults to `2MiB`. The gateway returns a `413` error if the request exceeds the limit.

### Fixes

- Improved subgraph request performance.
- Better error message when graph ref contains the account name.
- Gateway timeout wasn't applied when executing a query or mutation with a streaming response. The operation preparation (parsing, validation, planning) is always subject to the timeout.
