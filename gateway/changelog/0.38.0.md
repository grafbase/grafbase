### Features

* **Per-Subgraph mTLS Configuration**: You can now configure mutual TLS (mTLS) independently for each subgraph. This feature allows for specifying a root CA certificate (or a certificate bundle) and a client identity file, which should contain the PEM-encoded certificate and private key (in PKCS#8 format) in the same file.
    * Key configuration options include:
        * `root.certificate`: Path to the root CA certificate or certificate chain.
        * `root.is_bundle`: Set to `true` if using a chain of certificates.
        * `identity`: Path to the client identity file (PEM cert and key).
        * `allow_invalid_certs`: A flag that should only be set to `true` during development.
    * **Important Considerations**:
        * If a subgraph utilizes a self-signed certificate, the Certificate Authority (CA) must have the hostname listed in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) section.
        * The private key must be in RSA, SEC1 Elliptic Curve, or PKCS#8 format.
* **Enhanced `@derive` Directive for Lists**:
    * The `@derive` directive now supports lists, enabling automatic derivation of related data collections. For instance, `comments: [Comment!]! @derive` can be used to fetch an array of comments based on a list of `commentIds`.
    * Explicit mapping for derived lists is also possible, for example: `comments: [Comment!]! @derive @is(field: "commentIds[{ id: . }]")` [cite: 10] or for composite keys like `inventories: [Inventory!]! @derive @is(field: "inventoriesKeys[{ countryId warehouseId }]")`.
    * This enhancement includes comprehensive support for `skip`/`include` directives, authorization rules, and joins involving derived list fields.
    * The `@derive` directive was introduced to automatically infer fields that can be derived from names and types (similar to `@lookup`), while the `@is` directive is now specifically for explicit mapping definitions. It's enforced that at least one `@key` directive must match the derived type.
* **Improved Field Selection for Derived Data**:
    * Support for an identity accessor `.` within the `@is` directive has been added for `@derive`, which simplifies mappings such as `comments: [Comment!] @derive @is(field: "commentIds[{ id: . }]")`.
    * Lists without a path can now be used with `@require` for batching purposes, for example: `comment(ids: [ID!]! @require(field: "[commentId]"))`.
* **Core Engine Support for Derived Fields**:
    * The query-solver has been updated to correctly generate query plans for fields that are derived using the `@is` directive (e.g., `author: User! @is(field: "{ id: author_id }")`).
    * The gateway's shaping and de-serialization logic for derived fields has been enhanced, ensuring proper handling of `skip`/`include` directives and authorization rules.
* **Flexible CORS Configuration**:
    * Glob pattern support has been added for specifying CORS origins, allowing for more flexible origin matching (e.g., `https://*.example.com`).
    * The gateway now also accepts `"*"` as a wildcard for origins, maintaining backward compatibility with the existing `"any"` option, and supports single string values for origin configuration.
* **Docker Build Improvements**:
    * The `docker-gateway` image now includes arm64 builds, expanding platform support.

### Fixes

* **Skip/Include Directive Handling**: Corrected the handling of `skip`/`include` directives when used with requirements in the context of derived fields. This ensures consistent behavior in both subgraph requests and the final GraphQL response.
