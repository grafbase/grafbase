    This is a test MCP server with no mutations.

    This is a GraphQL server that provides tools to access certain selected operations.
    The operation requires certain arguments, and always a selection. You can construct the
    correct selection by first looking into the description of the query tool, finding the
    return type, and then calling the introspect-type tool with the name of the type.

    This tool will provide you all the information to construct a correct selection for the query. You always have to
    call the introspect-type tool first, and only after that you can call the correct query tool.

    Queries are prefixed with query/ and mutations with mutation/.
