//! Event queuing functionality for tracking and recording request events.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive event queuing capabilities for tracking various
//! types of operations and requests within the Grafbase Gateway system. It supports tracking
//! of GraphQL operations, subgraph requests, HTTP requests, and custom extension logs.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The event queue system is designed to capture detailed information about:
//! - GraphQL operation execution (including timing, caching, and status)
//! - Subgraph request details (including retries, caching, and response times)
//! - HTTP request execution
//! - Custom extension logs with serializable data
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use grafbase_sdk::host_io::event_queue;
//! use serde::Serialize;
//!
//! #[derive(Serialize)]
//! struct CustomEvent {
//!     user_id: String,
//!     action: String,
//!     timestamp: u64,
//! }
//!
//! // Send a custom event
//! let log = CustomEvent {
//!     user_id: "user123".to_string(),
//!     action: "query_execution".to_string(),
//!     timestamp: 1234567890,
//! };
//!
//! event_queue::send("custom_event", log).expect("Failed to send event");
//! ```
//!
//! # Log Aggregation
//!
//! By itself, event queue calls do nothing in the Grafbase Gateway. You must implement
//! an [`Hosts`] type of an extension with event filtering, which will be called after
//! a response is sent back to the user.
