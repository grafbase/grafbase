//! # Host IO modules.
//!
//! This module contains IO modules, providing IO operations to the guest handled by the host runtime.
//! The interfaces are blocking from the guest's perspective, but the host runtime executes the IO asynchronously without
//! blocking the host thread when guest is waiting for IO.
