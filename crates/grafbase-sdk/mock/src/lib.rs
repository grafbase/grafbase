//! Provides a dynamic GraphQL schema and subgraph implementation that can be built and executed at runtime.
//!
//! This crate allows creating GraphQL schemas dynamically from SDL (Schema Definition Language) strings
//! and executing queries against them. It also provides functionality for running mock GraphQL servers
//! using these dynamic schemas.
