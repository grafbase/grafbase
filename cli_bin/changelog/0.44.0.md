### Breaking

- `grafbase init`: Change the default directory that gets filled with the schema.graphl or grafbase.config.ts to the current directory rather than a 'grafbase' subdirectory.

### Features

- Update the default contents of configuration files used in newly initiated projects.

### Fixes

- When namespaced, the graphql connector wouldn't correctly rename inputs types within lists.
