### Features

- A new `grafbase check` command to run schema checks in federated and single
  graph projects.
- `grafbase publish` can now take the schema SDL to publish from stdin as an
  alternative to a file with the `--schema` parameter. This enables piping the
  output of introspect into publish. (#1083)
- In all commands that take a `PROJECT_REF` argument (account/project@branch),
  the branch is now optional. It will default to the main branch of the
  project. (#1081)
- `grafbase init` now generates an initial configuration that takes the latest
  changes in @@grafbase/sdk into account.

### Fixes

- File watcher fixes (#1064). `grafbase dev`, was watching too many files,
  leading to unnecessary reloads.
