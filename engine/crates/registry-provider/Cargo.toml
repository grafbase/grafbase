# FIXME: https://github.com/grafbase/api/pull/2099#discussion_r1176200512
# Due to cyclic dependency, we have to create this crate, the idea would be to
# move the grafbase-engine registry into another crate to avoid having to
# import grafbase-engine directly inside `gateway-protocol`.
# While moving the Grafbase Engine Registry into another crate, it would be
# interesting to also move the VersionnedRegistry.
