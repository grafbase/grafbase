//! Execution plans are responsible to retrieve a selection_set from a certain point in the query.
//!
//! Supposing we have a query like this:
//! ```graphql
//! query {
//!     catalog {
//!         products {
//!             name
//!             price
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If `prices` comes from a different data source we would have two plans like:
//! ```graphql
//! # Catalog plan
//! query {
//!     catalog {
//!         products {
//!             id
//!             name
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```graphql
//! # Price plan
//! query {
//!      _entities(representations: [...]) {
//!         ... on Product {
//!             price
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Execution plans define what to do at runtime for a given query. They only depend on the
//! operation and thus can be cached and do not depend on any context. On the other hand,
//! Executors are context (variables, response, headers, etc.) depend and built from the execution plans
//!
//! The executor for the catalog plan would have a single response object root and the price plan
//! executor will have a root for each product in the response.
