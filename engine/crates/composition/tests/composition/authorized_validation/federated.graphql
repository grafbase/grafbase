# [bank-account]: Error validating the @authorized directive at Mutation.createUser: could not parse the `arguments` argument in `@authorized` as a selection set: invalid token: -
# Error in @authorized at Account.balance: the userId field does not exist on Account
# Error in @authorized at Account.transactions: the accountLevel field does not exist on Account
# Error in @authorized: the userId argument does not exist on Mutation.deleteUser. Did you use the `arguments` argument instead of `fields`?
