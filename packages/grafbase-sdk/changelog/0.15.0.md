### New Features

- Federated graph now supports JWT Authentication through `auth`.
  ```ts
  config({
    graph: graph.Federated(),
    auth: {
      providers: [
        auth.JWT({
          jwks: {
            url: 'https:://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json',
            issuer: 'https://example.com',
            audience: 'my-server'
          }
        })
      ]
    }
  })
  ```
