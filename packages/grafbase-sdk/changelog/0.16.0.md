### New Features

- Both standalone and federated graphs now support configuring operation limits.

  ```ts
  config({
    graph: graph.Federated(),
    operationLimits: {
      complexity: 100,
      depth: 5,
      height: 20
    }
  })
  ```

  ```ts
  config({
    graph: graph.Standalone(),
    operationLimits: {
      rootFields: 4,
      aliases: 10
    }
  })
  ```
