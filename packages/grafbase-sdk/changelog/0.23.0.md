## Features

- The `codegen` experimental feature is stabilized. The `codegen` option can be used in this way now:

```ts
export default config({
  graph: g,
  codegen: {
    enabled: true,
    // Optional: define the directory path where you want the generated code to be written, relative to your grafbase configuration. Default: "generated".
    path: 'generated',
  },
})
```

## Deprecations

- The `kv`, `ai` and `codegen` experimental feature options are deprecated. Codegen is stabilized, but `kv` and `ai` are being removed.
