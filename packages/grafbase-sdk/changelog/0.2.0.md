### New Features

- Connectors can now be configured to forward headers via the set method

```ts
import { connector } from '@grafbase/sdk'

const shopify = connector.GraphQL({
  url: g.env('SHOPIFY_STORE_API_URL'),
  headers: headers => {
    headers.set('Authorization', { forward: "Authorization" })
  }
})
```

### Deprecated

- The `headers.static` method has been deprecated in favour of `set`
