### Features

- Add create, update and delete batch mutations. So for a type `Post` we have `postCreateMany`, `postUpdateMany` and `postDeleteMany`.
- OpenAPI & GraphQL connectors can now forward headers from clients

### Bug fixes

- For update mutations, like `postUpdate`, nullable fields can now be set to `null`. Previously, those updates
  were ignored.
- Improved support for v2 of the OpenAPI specification.
- Fixed an issue where errors during resolver startup would not be shown
