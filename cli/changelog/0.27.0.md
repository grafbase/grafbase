### Features

- Add create and update batch operations `postCreateMany` and `postUpdateMany`.
- OpenAPI & GraphQL connectors can now forward headers from clients (currently
  via SDL configuration only).

### Bug fixes

- For update mutations, like `postUpdate`, nullable fields can now be set to `null`. Previously, those updates
  would be ignored.
- Improved support for v2 of the OpenAPI specification.
- Fixed an issue where errors during resolver startup would not be shown
