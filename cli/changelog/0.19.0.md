### Features

- Allows passing arguments to `create` rather than using interactive input

  ```
  Usage: grafbase create [OPTIONS]

  Options:
  -n, --name <name>       The name to use for the new project
  -a, --account <slug>    The slug of the account in which the new project should be created
  -r, --regions <region>  The regions in which the database for the new project should be created
  -h, --help              Print help
  ```

- Supports passing a `GRAFBASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable rather than logging in (e.g. for CI environments)
  - Note: being logged in via `grafbase login` takes precedence over supplying `GRAFBASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### Fixes

- Fixes a few cases of output to STDERR instead of STDOUT
