### Features

- The Grafbase API URl can now be set via the `GRAFBASE_API_URL` env var (#1430)
- [Trusted documents](https://grafbase.com/changelog/introducing-trusted-documents) support in `grafbase federated start` (#1436)
- Many new configuration options and revamped arguments for `grafbase federated start`

### Bug fixes

- `grafbase introspect --dev` now includes subgraph federation directives. This was an omission that made the `grafbase introspect --dev | grafbase publish` workflow for federated projects impossible. (#1438)
