## Features

- Added support for system and file loggers in the Grafbase SDK (https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/pull/3251).

  Extensions can now use the new logging APIs to write logs to the system logger or to custom log files. This enables better debugging and monitoring capabilities for extension developers. The SDK provides structured logging with support for different log levels and file rotation.

## Improvements

- CLI assets are now downloaded from S3 instead of R2 for improved reliability and performance (https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/pull/3248).
