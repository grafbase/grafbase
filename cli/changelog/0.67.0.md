### Features

- `grafbase dev` for federated graphs can now read predefined subgraphs from
  `grafbase.config.ts` to save users having to publish them.
- Caching in standalone graphs now suppports interface types

### Fixes

- Standlalone Graphs no longer remove interfaces that aren't used directly but
  are implemented by at least one type.
- `grafbase trust` now has better error messages when failing to parse a
  manifest.
