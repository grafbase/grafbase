## Improvements

- If you explicitly pass `--virtual` to the `publish` command, and the subgraph already has a URL, it will now become virtual, instead of keeping its URL previously.
- Clearer rules for composition extensions, that are now documented in [the online docs](https://grafbase.com/docs/gateway/extensions/composition) and the graphql-composition crate [`README`](https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/blob/main/crates/graphql-composition/README.md). This release also includes propagating the `@link` directives to import directives composed with `@composeDirective` in the federated schema.
