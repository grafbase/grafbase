### Breaking

- Hashes the value of `@unique` items to reduce ID length
  - Previously stored items will not behave correctly

### Features

- Supports ordering by the `createdAt` field
- Modifies the `PhoneNumber` scalar to follow the E.164 format
- Ensures that the ULID time component is equal to the `createdAt` field
- Adds support for identity providers that use the same issuer for multiple applications

### Fixes

- Fixes the formatting of an unknown argument error
- Fixes a few instances of input coercion to be in line with the GraphQL spec
