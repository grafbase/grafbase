### WASI Extension Logger JSON Output

Fixed an issue where structured fields logged by WASI guest components were double-escaped in JSON formatted logs, making them difficult to parse.

**Before:**
```json
{
  "guest_fields": "{\"method\": \"POST\", \"status_code\": \"200\", \"url\": \"/graphql\"}"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "guest_fields": {
    "method": "POST",
    "status_code": "200",
    "url": "/graphql"
  }
}
```
