## Breaking

- Removes the fallback to `$PROJECT/.grafbase` as the home directory if no specific home directory is specified and the user home directory can not be found

## Features

- Allows setting the location of the configuration directory by either setting `--home` (`gb --home path/to/dir dev / login / create / ...`) or the `GRAFBASE_HOME` environment variable.
  - Note: `/.grafbase` is appended to either of these if used
  - Note: `--home` takes precedence over `GRAFBASE_HOME` if both are specified, and both override the default user home directory
- Adds `@graphql` directive header pass-through

## Fixes

- Stops manually initializing the environment when running `reset`
- Fixes OIDC discovery URL handling containing path, enabling using Azure AD
- Fixes an issue with live queries
