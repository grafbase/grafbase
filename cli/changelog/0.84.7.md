## Fixes

- The GraphQL Explorer (Pathfinder) bundled in grafbase dev was not loading.
- In grafbase dev, new validations are introduced for bad imports and bad directive usages in subgraph SDLs. The optionality of the `url` argument is also now reflected in the emitted directive definitions for `@join__graph` (https://github.com/grafbase/grafbase/pull/2600).
