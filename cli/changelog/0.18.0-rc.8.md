## Breaking

- The location of the local database was moved to a subfolder and will reset after this update

## Features

- Supports the new Grafbase playground
- OpenAPI support improvements
  - Default value support
  - General improvements
- Allows the combination of owner-based auth rules with private/group-based rules in the global scope

## Fixes

- Prevents `reset` from removing link files
- Allows introspection without auth locally
- Prevents an issue with `create` when the `.grafbase` folder didn't previously exist
