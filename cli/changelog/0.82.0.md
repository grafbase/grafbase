## Features

Introducing a dev command to run your federated graph in your local dev environment. The command starts a gateway server and a Pathfinder server to load in the browser. The command loads all the subgraphs from the graph reference together with the local overrides, producing a federated schema to query against in the Pathfinder. All changes to the subgraph are automatically registered to the federated schema. The gateway server also reloads the schema when the subgraph changes.
