### Features

* Added support for Kafka producer and consumer resources in the WASI component loader

### Bug Fixes & Improvements

* Improved error handling during `grafbase upgrade` by mapping `reqwest::Error` to `io::Error` more appropriately using `io::Error::other`
* Engine Logging:
    * Changed operation warming log level from `INFO` to `DEBUG`.
    * Changed "Warming finished" log message to "Finished warming {} operations" for clarity.
    * Changed subgraph request failure log level from `ERROR` to `DEBUG` when the HTTP status indicates failure, to reduce noise for expected failures (e.g., during testing or due to subgraph errors).
