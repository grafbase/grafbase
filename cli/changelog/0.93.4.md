### Breaking changes

* The CLI will now try to expand environment variables everywhere in the `grafbase.toml` configuration with the syntax `{{ env>VAR_NAME }}`.

### Improvements

* GraphQL schema validation is now run on every subgraph schema before composition in `grafbase dev` and `grafbase compose`. That makes for better error messages.

### Fixes

* fix(engine): avoid crashing with x-grafbase-telemetry & lookup
* fix(engine): Proper shape computation for lookup fields. Fixed an index range issue causing the root selection set to include all nested fields.
* fix(cli): fix extension name collisions in `grafbase dev` when importing the same extension in multiple subgraphs. Composition now handles multiple definitions if URLs are compatible. `grafbase dev` also adds extensions from `grafbase.toml` to composition input for precedence.
